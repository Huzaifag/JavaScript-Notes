## Lesson 1.8: Basic Operators
JavaScript supports basic operators for arithmetic and comparison.

Example : 
```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
```
>Arithmatic Operations
```javascript
let sum = x + y;
let difference = x - y;
let product = x * y;
let qoutient = x / y;
let reminder = x % y;
//Printing Values
console.log("Sum:" + sum);
console.log("Differnce:" + difference);
console.log("Product:" + product);
console.log("Qoutient:" + qoutient);
console.log("Reminder" + reminder);
```
>Comparison operators
```javascript
let isEqual = x === y;
let notEqual = x !== y;

console.log("isEqual:" + isEqual);
console.log("notEqual:" + notEqual);
```
